# imap-tests
Test exercises with Python's imaplib using Python 3.5


Imaplib-connect.py establishes a secure connection to Google's mail servers. You must change the username and password to login. Imaplib-fetch.py retrieves the first(most recently received) email from your Inbox with a particular keyword. Change the keyword as you like. It then will convert the email from binary and print the email broken into pieces (to, from, subject, body).
